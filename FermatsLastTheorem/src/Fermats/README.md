# Fermat's Last Theorem Near Misses Finder

## Overview

This Java program helps users search for "near misses" of Fermat's Last Theorem, where xn + yn â‰  zn, with user-defined parameters.

## Usage

Step 1
Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command: 

https://github.com/krish143225/SE-ass1.git

Step 2
Compile the Java program: javac F fermatsmain.java

Step 3
Run the program: java  fermatsmain.java

Step 4
Follow the on-screen instructions to input values for `n` and `k`.

## Program Logic

- The program takes user input for `n` and `k` within specified ranges.

- It systematically searches for `x`, `y`, and `z` combinations that are close to satisfying Fermat's Last Theorem.

- The smallest relative miss is tracked and displayed as the program runs.

- After processing all combinations, the program displays the smallest relative miss.

## Input Ranges

- `n` should be greater than 2 and less than 12.

- `k` should be greater than 10 and less than the upper limit (50 by default, but you can change it in the code).

## Requirements

- Java JDK installed on your computer.
